#Stains
Stains is a JavaScript/WebGL library that I created to mimic the
visual appearance and behaviour of aquarelle on a canvas. The library, which can
procedurally generate aquarelle paintings is used to create
artistic-looking elements for my personal website and allow visitors to interact with the content.
It does not necessarily serve a much deeper purpose than simply looking visually appealing,
but I also think it is an interesting proof-of-concept for a style of computer graphics,
that could be used in other contexts, such as digital storytelling,
computer games, VJing or other forms of interactive art.
